 Types that wish to implement Attributed extensions should adapt `AttributedCompatible` first 
 and then write extensions in the format of: 
    
    `extension Attributed where Base == SomeType { ... }`
 
 The merit of adapting the `AttributedCompatible` protocol
 is that methods defined in this mannor are grouped under their own `at` namespace, therefore the chance 
 of naming collisions is lower and when reading through code that uses the attributed library it is clear 
 what is an extension that Attributed provides and what is not.
